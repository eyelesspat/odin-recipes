    <h2>Velvet Mashed Potatoes</h2>
    <p>They taste just like they soundâ€”creamy, smooth and velvety!</p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li> medium boiling potatoes, peeled and cut into large pieces (4 pounds)</li>
    <li>3/4 to 1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 package (8-ounce size) cream cheese, cut into cubes and softened</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>Heat 1 inch water (salted if desired) to boiling in Dutch oven. Add potatoes. Cover and heat to boiling; reduce heat. Cook 20 to 25 minutes or until tender; drain. Shake pan with potatoes over low heat to dry. </li>
      <li>Mash potatoes in large bowl until no lumps remain. Beat in milk in small amounts, beating after each addition (amount of milk needed to make potatoes smooth and fluffy depends on kind of potatoes used). Add cream cheese, butter, salt and pepper.
