  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 sticks (16 Tbsp) Unsalted butter  </li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar                   </li>
    <li>1½ cups brown sugar                 </li>
    <li>2 eggs                              </li>
    <li>11 ½ ounces all purpose flour       </li>
    <li>1 Tbsp kosher salt                  </li>
    <li> ½ tsp baking soda                  </li>
    <li>¾ tsp cinnamon                      </li>
    <li>Chocolate chips                     </li>
    <li>Nuts (walnuts or your favorite)     </li>
    <li>Flaky sea salt                      </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter. Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it's re-solidified.</li>
      <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar. Mix well to combine.</li>
      <li>Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.</li>
      <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour, 1 Tbsp of kosher salt, ½ tsp of baking soda, and ¾ tsp of cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients. This helps keep your gluten down.</li>
      <li>Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer. Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.</li>
      <li>Optional: You can toast some nuts and add those to your cookie dough as well.</li>
      <li>Roll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet. This will help give the cookies a rustic look. Bake in a 350°F oven for 12-17 minutes or until they’ve reached your preferred doneness. Top with a little bit of sea salt.</li>
      <li>Let cool for a few minutes, serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
